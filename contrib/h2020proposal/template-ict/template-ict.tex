%\documentclass[]{h2020proposal}     % Remove 'draft' option for final version

%% Extra Packages
%% ========
%\usepackage{fontspec}% Latin Modern by default with xelatex

%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
%\usepackage[utf8,latin1]{inputenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
%% If they persist, remove the .aux file and try again.
\usepackage[english]{babel}

%% For underlined wrapped text.
\usepackage{soul}

%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.  Do not change this.
\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo} % Not needed with xelatex

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.  Do not
%% remove.
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts,mathrsfs}

%% Gantt Charts in LaTeX
\usepackage{pgfgantt}

%% LaTeX' own graphics handling
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% Fancy character protrusion.  Must be loaded after all fonts.
\usepackage[activate]{pdfcprot}

%% Nicer tables.  Read the excellent documentation.
\usepackage{booktabs}

% Compressed itemized lists (with a * at the end)
\usepackage{mdwlist}

%% Nicer URLs.  
\usepackage{url}

%% Configure citation styles
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress,square]{natbib}
\def\bibfont{\footnotesize}     %for smaller fonts in the biblio section

%% Hyper Ref package. In order to operate correctly, it must be the last package declared
\usepackage[colorlinks,pagebackref,breaklinks]{hyperref} 

%% Extra package options
\hypersetup{
  hypertexnames=true, linkcolor=blue, anchorcolor=black,
  citecolor=blue, urlcolor=blue  
}

\urlstyle{rm} %so it doesn't use a typewriter font for urls.
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.jpg,.pdf,.mps,.png} % for pdflatex
\graphicspath{{img/} {./}} %put all figures in these dirs

\newcommand{\alert}[1]{{\color{red}\textbf{#1}}}

\instructions{Please follow the structure of this template when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an effective assessment against the evaluation criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each correspond to an evaluation criterion for a full proposal.}
\vskip0.5cm
\instructions{Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they were submitted, rather than on their potential if certain changes were to be made. This means that only proposals that successfully address all the required aspects will have a chance of being funded. There will be no possibility for significant changes to content, budget and consortium composition during grant preparation.}

\instructions{\textbf{First stage proposals:} In two-stage submission schemes, at the first stage you only need to complete the parts indicated by a bracket (i.e. \} ) . These are in the cover page, and sections 1 and 2.}
\vskip0.5cm
\instructions{\textbf{Page limit:} For full proposals, the cover page, and sections 1, 2 and 3, together should not be longer than 70 pages. All tables in these sections must be included within this limit. The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers).}
\vskip0.5cm
\instructions{The page limit for a first stage proposal is 15 pages.}
\vskip0.5cm
\instructions{If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified limit, before the deadline you will receive an automatic warning, and will be advised to shorten and re-upload the proposal. After the deadline, any excess pages will be overprinted with a ‘watermark’, indicating to evaluators that these pages must be disregarded.}
\vskip0.5cm
\instructions{Please do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since experts rarely view unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light.}













%% TITLE
\maketitle
\instructions{
Maximum length for Sections 1,2,3: 70 pages including all tables.\\ 

Please use the same participant numbering as that used in the administrative proposal forms. (Not applicable in the case of stage-1 proposals in two stage schemes.)\\
For first stage proposals, please note that this table will be used to check whether or not you comply with any minimum requirements linked to participation as set out in the eligibility criteria of the relevant work programme.
