The pmat package can be used to typeset partitioned matrices in
TeX, LaTeX, and LaTeX2e. I hope it will be useful to you. Please
let me know of any suggestions for improvement, general comments,
etc. My e-mail address is tos@inesca.pt

The package is provided "as is". The files pmat.tex, pmat.sty and
readme (this file) should be copied together. These files are
freeware. You should not change them in any way, nor use them in
a commercial product without prior concent.
