v1.1:  1 January 1201 (1 January 2017):  There was an error
in setting defaults that meant that paper size had to be set
explicitly.  Now it's set to the default installation paper
size, and must be explicitly changed.  Also, the default
bottom margin was changed to a full inch, to leave room for
the footer.  Finally, added the "signatureword" option to
the documentation.

v1.0:  23 December 1200 (27 December 2016):  Initial
release.
