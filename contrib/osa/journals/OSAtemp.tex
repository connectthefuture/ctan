\section{Introduction}
Refer to \texttt{OSAstyle.tex} for guidelines on manuscript preparation, use of \mbox{Bib\TeX}, and similar. Our new style file (July 2003 version of \texttt{osajnl.sty}) has reduced line space to help save paper.

To facilitate conversion, place all math in a proper math environment. For example, expression $3\times 4 = 12$ should be set this way, \texttt{\$3$\backslash$times 4=12\$}, not this way, \texttt{3 \$$\backslash$times\$4=12}.
\section{Conclusion}

After the manuscript is proofread, the {\tt .tex} file and figures
should be archived with tar-gzip compression. Do not include
subdirectories within the archive.

To upload your manuscript, follow the instructions on the each
journal's homepage (see \mbox{\href{http://www.opticsinfobase.org}{http://www.opticsinfobase.org}}).
Authors should feel free to contact OSA staff for assistance; details are available at \href{InfoBase}{http://www.opticsinfobase.org}.
