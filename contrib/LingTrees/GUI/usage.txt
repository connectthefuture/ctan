Put treebutton.py and treerunner.ico in the same folder as trees.py.
The icon only works in Windoze.

Requires Python 2.4 with Tkinter and Tix installed.  These are now
nominally standard parts of a Python distribution, but don't always
appear in all Linux distros as of March 2006.  E.g. Tix seems to be
broken in Ubuntu 5.10, and absent from the default install of SUSE 10.0
(but present if you select all the geek stuff).  I had success with
ActiveState python 2.4.10 on Ubuntu (installed GNU readline5.1 prior
to that; dunno if that was essential)

TreeButton can be made to interact reasonably well with the TeXnicCenter
front-end for (La)TeX by changing the "%Wm" at the end of the  command
line specifications in the output profiles to "%bm" (base-name without
extension of file being edited).  Then you can have the .txp file
loaded in the TXC window, push the TreeButton button to run Trees, and
then build as usual in TXC.
