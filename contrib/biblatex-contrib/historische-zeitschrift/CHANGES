 Version history
 ---------------
v1.2 [2016/12/01]
 - Compatible with biblatex >3.3 (thanks to Herbert Voß)
 
v1.1a [2014/07/22]
 - This is a minor bugfix release.
 - BUG FIX: The opening bracket in \ProvidesFile of 
   historische-zeitschrift.cbx was missing.
 - README: Updated link to house style.

v1.1 [2014/06/05]
 - This is a bugfix release.

v1.0 [2012/06/11]
 - Compatible with biblatex 1.7.
 - New option 'dashed' (analogue to the option provided by
   the standard biblatex styles).
 - @review is now supported (as an alias for @article).
 
v0.9a [2010/10/18]
 - Compatibility to biblatex 0.9e.
 - New option 'postnote'. This option can take the values 
   'inparen' and 'afterparen', where 'inparen' puts the 
   postnote in subsequent citations inside the parenthesis 
   holding the 'see note N' phrase. The default is 
   'afterparen' (thus, the default behaviour has changed, 
   because the HZ style requires it. The style description 
   was wrong at this point, and I did not check properly in 
   the printed journal. Therefore, the biblatex style 
   'historische-zeitschrift' was wrong in this particular 
   point. For compatibility reasons, and because it might be 
   useful, I turned the wrong behaviour into the option
   'postnote=inparen').
 - @reference and @inreference are now supported (as an 
   alias for @collection and @incollection, respectively, as 
   they do not require special treatment).

v0.9 [2010/03/11]
 - Compatibility to biblatex 0.9
 - The options 'doi', 'eprint' and 'url' are supported. The
   defaults are 'doi=false', 'eprint=false' and 'url=true'.
 - Added the file 'historische-zeitschrift.lbx' for the
   handling of (German) language related issues.

v0.8 [2008/10/20]
 - Initial public release
