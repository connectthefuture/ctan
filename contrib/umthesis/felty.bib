  abstract = {The representation of regular morphological processes has been the
	subject of much controversy, particularly in the debate between single
	and dual route models of morphology. I present a model of morphological
	learning that posits rules and seeks to infer their productivity
	by comparing their reliability in different phonological environments.
	The result of this procedure is a grammar in which general rules
	exist alongside more specific, but more reliable, generalizations
	describing subregularities for the same process. I present results
	from a nonce-probe (WUG) experiment in Italian, in which speakers
	rated the acceptability of novel infinitives in various conjugation
	classes. These results indicate that such subregularities are in
	fact internalized by speakers, even for a regular morphological process.},

  abstract = {Are morphological patterns learned in the form of rules? Some models
	deny this, attributing all morphology to analogical mechanisms. The
	dual mechanism model (Pinker, S., & Prince, A. (1998). On language
	and connectionism: analysis of a parallel distributed processing
	model of language acquisition. Cognition, 28, 73-193) posits that
	speakers do internalize rules, but that these rules are few and cover
	only regular processes; the remaining patterns are attributed to
	analogy. This article advocates a third approach, which uses multiple
	stochastic rules and no analogy. We propose a model that employs
	inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence
	scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported
	over the two alternatives by new "wug test" data on English past
	tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend
	on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly,
	also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under
	the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single
	rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology
	is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates
	novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested
	against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key
	respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural
	characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on
	single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend
	morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of
	a kind appropriately described with rules.},

  abstract = {Two cross-modal priming experiments address issues concerning the
	representation and processing of regular and irregular morphology
	in English as well as methodological issues concerning the use of
	the cross-modal technique in lexical processing studies. Cross-modal
	inflectional priming facilitates regular verbs (e.g., walked priming
	walk) but not irregular verbs (e.g., gave priming give). We found
	that similar but morphologically unrelated words (e.g., slam priming
	slim) inhibit each other when presented cross-modally. Based on this
	effect for form-based inhibition, we interpret the regular/irregular
	verb priming asymmetry as a reflection of competition between orthographically
	similar verb forms (e.g., gave-give) which results in target inhibition.
	In support of this proposal, we found that orthographically dissimilar
	irregular verbs (e.g., taught-teach) show strong priming facilitation.
	We account for this result in terms of a two-level lexicon in which
	irregular verb alternates have distinct form-level entries, but engage
	a common entry at an abstract morphological level of representation.
	In addition to serving as evidence concerning the representation
	of English verbal inflection, the findings from these experiments
	also set important limits on the claim that the cross-modal priming
	paradigm automatically circumvents form-related processing effects
	that are not morphological in character.},

  abstract = {Wordlikeness, the extent to which a sound sequence is typical of words
	in a language, affects language acquisition, language processing,
	and verbal short-term memory. Wordlikeness has generally been equated
	with phonotactic knowledge of the possible or probable sequences
	of sounds within a language. Alternatively, wordlikeness might be
	derived directly from the mental lexicon, depending only on similarity
	to known words. This paper tests these two cognitively different
	possibilities by comparing measures of phonotactic probability and
	lexical influence, including a new model of lexical neighborhoods,
	in their ability to explain empirical wordlikeness judgments. Our
	data show independent contributions of both phonotactic probability
	and the lexicon, with relatively greater influence from the lexicon.
	The influence of a lexical neighbor is found to be an inverted-U-shaped
	function of its token frequency. However, our results also indicate
	that current measures are limited in their ability to account for

  abstract = {Following much work in linguistic theory, it is hypothesized that
	the language faculty has a modular structure and consists of two
	basic components, a lexicon of (structured) entries and a computational
	system of combinatorial operations to form larger linguistic expressions
	from lexical entries. This target article provides evidence for the
	dual nature of the language faculty by describing recent results
	of a multidisciplinary investigation of German inflection. We have
	examined: (1) its linguistic representation, focussing on noun plurals
	and verb inflection (participles), (2) processes involved in the
	way adults produce and comprehend inflected words, (3) brain potentials
	generated during the processing of inflected words, and (4) the way
	children acquire and use inflection. It will be shown that the evidence
	from all these sources converges and supports the distinction between
	lexical entries and combinatorial operations. Our experimental results
	indicate that adults have access to two distinct processing routes,
	one accessing (irregularly) inflected entries from the mental lexicon
	and another involving morphological decomposition of (regularly)
	inflected words into stem affix representations. These two processing
	routes correspond to the dual structure of the linguistic system.
	Results from event-related potentials confirm this linguistic distinction
	at the level of brain structures. In children’s language, we have
	also found these two processes to be clearly dissociated; regular
	and irregular inflection are used under different circumstances,
	and the constraints under which children apply them are identical
	to those of the adult linguistic system. 
	
	
	Our findings will be explained in terms of a linguistic model that
	maintains the distinction between the lexicon and the computational
	system but replaces the traditional view of the lexicon as a simple
	list of idiosyncrasies with the notion of internally structured lexical
	representations.},

	to twelve-year olds) and 35 adult native speakers of German listened
	to stem forms of verbs presented in a sentential context and were
	asked to produce corresponding participle forms as quickly and accurately
	as possible. Dependent variables were the subjects' participle-production
	latencies and error rates. We found contrasts between the production
	of regular and irregular forms in both children and adults, with
	respect to the production latencies and types of morphological error.
	Children overapplied the regular patterns to forms that are irregular
	in the adult language, but not vice versa. High-frequency irregular
	participles were produced faster (and amongst the children more accurately)
	than low-frequency ones, whereas regular participles yielded a reverse
	frequency effect, i.e. longer production latencies for high-frequency
	forms than for low-frequency ones, in the two groups of children
	as well as in one subgroup of adults. We explain these findings from
	the perspective of dual-mechanism models of inflection arguing that
	the mental mechanisms and representations for processing morphologically
	complex words ('words' and 'rules') are the same in children and
	adults, and that the observed child/adult differences in participle
	production are due to slower and less accurate lexical access in
	children than in adults.},

	Further, it was assumed that L2 phonological representations would

	stimuli, the NS groups recognized more words from dense neighborhoods
	than the NE group did. For native-produced stimuli, the low-proficiency
	NS group recognized fewer words than the other two groups. The-high

	different ways. A desirable decomposition can be achieved if the
	architecture is suitably restricted in the types of functions that

	and Bever (1988) presented detailed critiques of Rumelhart and McClelland's
	(1986) connectionist model of the child's learning of the phonological
	form of the English past tense. In order to address these criticisms,
	a new connectionist model was constructed using the back-propagation
	algorithm, a larger input corpus, a fuller paradigm, and a new phonological
	representation. This new implementation successfully addressed the
	criticisms of the phonological representation used by Rumelhart and
	McClelland. It did a much better job of learning the past tense using
	a fuller input set with realistic frequencies of occurrence. Ancillary
	simulations using the same network were able to deal with the homonymy
	problem and the generation of forms like "ated" from "ate". The one
	feature not provided by the new model was a way of modeling early
	correct production of irregular forms. The success of the new model
	can be used to help clarify the extent to which the published critiques
	apply to a particular connectionist implementation as opposed to
	fundamental principles underlying the broader connectionist conceptualization.},

  abstract = {Language is often explained as the product of generative rules and
	a memorized lexicon. For example, most English verbs take a regular
	past tense suffix (ask-asked), which is applied to new verbs (faxed,
	wugged), suggesting the mental rule ''add-ed to a Verb.'' Irregular
	verbs (break-broke, go-went) would be listed in memory. Alternatively,
	a pattern associator memory (such as a connectionist network) might
	record all past tense forms and generalize to new ones by similarity;
	irregular and regular patterns would differ only because of their
	different numbers of verbs. We present evidence that mental rules
	are indispensible. A rule concatenates a suffix to a symbol for verbs,
	so it does not require access to memorized verbs or their sound patterns,
	but applies as the ''default,'' whenever memory access fails. We
	find 21 such circumstances for regular past tense formation, including
	novel, unusual-sounding, and rootless and headless derived words;
	in every case, people inflect them regularly (explaining quirks like
	flied out, sabre-tooths, walkmans). Contrary to the connectionist
	account, these effects are not due to regular words constituting
	a large majority of vocabulary. The German participle -t applies
	to a much smaller percentage of verbs than its English counterpart,
	and the German plural -s applies to a small minority of nouns. Bur
	the affixes behave in the language like their English counterparts,
	as defaults. We corroborate this effect in two experiments eliciting
	ratings of participle and plural forms of novel German words. Thus
	default suffixation is not due to numerous regular words reinforcing
	a pattern in associative memory. Because default cases do not occupy
	a cohesive similarity space, but do correspond to the range of a
	symbol, they are evidence for a memory-independent, symbol-concatenating
	mental operation},

  abstract = {Pinker and Prince (1988) argued that two dissociable systems underlie
	the development of linguistic representations: one rule governed
	and the other associative. These two dissociable systems of representation
	and processing are claimed to be a linguistic universal (Pinker,
	1999). Therefore, one should expect that nonnative speakers of a
	language also manifest the same kinds of dissociations in performance
	between rule-based and associative features of language as native
	speakers. The study reported here extends the work of Prasada and
	Pinker (1993) into the second language (L2) domain to test whether
	nonnative speakers (a) perform similarly to native speakers and (b)
	dissociate rule-based from associative features of language. In Prasada
	and Pinker, the degree of similarity between a nonce verb and a real
	English verb influenced past-tense generalizations on nonce irregular
	verbs but did not influence generalizations on nonce regular verbs.
	In the experiment reported here, first language (L1) and L2 participants
	of different ages and language groups were compared or the same task
	as that used by Prasada and Pinker. Participants overall produced
	more verbs with a past-tense suffix for nonce regular items than
	for the nonce irregular items. Significant group effects indicate
	that participants' varying levels of experience with English play
	an important role in their past-tense productions of nonce verbs.
	Furthermore, similarity influenced both the regular and irregular
	verbs on a production task. These results are discussed in terms
	of whether there are two dissociable systems underlying L2 linguistic
	knowledge and whether an alternative single associative learning
	mechanism could be responsible for the development of the system
	of regular and irregular inflectional morphology in both L1 and L2
	learning.},

	Rumelhart and McClelland have described a connectionist (parallel
	distributed processing) model of the acquisition of the past tense
	in English which successfully maps many stems onto their past tense
	forms, both regular (walk/walked) and irregular (go/went), and which
	mimics some of the errors and sequences of development of children.
	Yet the model contains no explicit rules, only a set of neuronstyle
	units which stand for trigrams of phonetic features of the stem,
	a set of units which stand for trigrams of phonetic features of the
	past form, and an array of connections between the two sets of units
	whose strengths are modified during learning. Rumelhart and McClelland
	conclude that linguistic rules may be merely convenient approximate
	fictions and that the real causal processes in language use and acquisition
	must be characterized as the transfer of activation levels among
	units and the modification of the weights of their connections. We
	analyze both the linguistic and the developmental assumptions of
	the model in detail and discover that (1) it cannot represent certain
	words, (2) it cannot learn many rules, (3) it can learn rules found
	in no human language, (4) it cannot explain morphological and phonological
	regularities, (5) it cannot explain the differences between irregular
	and regular forms, (6) it fails at its assigned task of mastering
	the past tense of English, (7) it gives an incorrect explanation
	for two developmental phenomena: stages of overregularization of
	irregular forms such as bringed, and the appearance of doubly-marked
	forms such as ated and (8) it gives accounts of two others (infrequent
	overregularization of verbs ending in t/d, and the order of acquisition
	of different irregular subclasses) that are indistinguishable from
	those of rule-based theories. In addition, we show how many failures
	of the model can be attributed to its connectionist architecture.
	We conclude that connectionists' claims about the dispensability
	of rules in explanations in the psychology of language must be rejected,
	and that, on the contrary, the linguistic and developmental facts
	provide good evidence for such rules.},

  abstract = {A three-layer back-propagation network is used to implement a pattern
	association task in which four types of mapping are learned. These
	mappings, which are considered analogous to those which characterize
	the relationship between the stem and past tense forms of English
	verbs, include arbitrary mappings, identity mappings, vowel changes,
	and additions of a suffix. The degree of correspondence between parallel
	distributed processing (PDP) models which learn mappings of this
	sort (e.g., Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986, 1987) and children's acquisition
	of inflectional morphology has recently been at issue in discussions
	of the applicability of PDP models to the study of human cognition
	and language (Pinker & Mehler, 1989; Bever, in press). In this paper,
	we explore the capacity of a network to learn these types of mappings,
	focusing on three major issues. First, we compare the performance
	of a single-layered perceptron similar to the one used by Rumerlhart
	and McClelland with a multi-layered perceptron. The results suggest
	that it is unlikely that a single-layered perceptron is capable of
	finding an adequate solution to the problem of mapping stems and
	past tense forms in input configurations that are sufficiently analogous
	to English. Second, we explore the input conditions which determine
	learning in these networks. Several factors that characterize linguistic
	input are investigated: (a) the nature of the mapping performed by
	the network (arbitrary, suffixation, identity, and vowel change);
	(b) the competition effects that arise when the task demands simultaneous
	learning of distinct mapping types; (c) the role of the type and
	token frequency of verb stems; and (d) the influence of phonological
	subregularities in the irregular verbs. Each of these factors is
	shown to have selective consequences on both successful and erroneous
	performance in the network. Third, we outline several types of systems
	which could result in U-shaped acquisition, and discuss the ways
	in which learning in multi-layered networks can be seen to capture
	several characteristics of U-shaped learning in children. In general,
	these models provide information about the role of input in determining
	the kinds of errors that a network will produce, including the conditions
	under which rule-like behavior and U-shaped learning will and will
	not emerge. The results from all simulations are discussed in light
	of behavioral data on children's acquisition of the past tense and
	the validity of drawing conclusions about the acquisition of language
	from models of this sort.},

  abstract = {The distinction between rules and similarity is central to our understanding
	of much of cognitive psychology. Two aspects of existing research
	have motivated the present work. First, in different cognitive psychology
	areas we typically see different conceptions of rules and similarity;
	for example, rules in language appear to be of a different kind compared
	to rules in categorization. Second, rules processes are typically
	modeled as separate from similarity ones; for example, in a learning
	experiment, rules and similarity influences would be described on
	the basis of separate models. in the present article, I assume that
	the rules versus similarity distinction can be understood in the
	same way in learning, reasoning, categorization, and language, and
	that a unified model for rules and similarity is appropriate. A rules
	process is considered to be a similarity one where only a single
	or a small subset of an object's properties are involved. Hence,
	rules and overall similarity operations are extremes in a single
	continuum of similarity operations. It is argued that this viewpoint
	allows adequate coverage of theory and empirical findings in learning,
	reasoning, categorization, and language, and also a reassessment
	of the objectives in research on rules versus similarity.},

  abstract = {How do we produce the past tenses of verbs? For the last 20 years
	this question has been the focal domain for conflicting theories
	of language, knowledge representation, and cognitive processing.
	On one side of the debate have been similarity-based or single-route
	approaches that propose that all past tenses are formed simply through
	phonological analogies to existing past tenses stored in memory.
	On the other side of the debate are rule-based or dual-route approaches
	which agree that phonological analogy is important for producing
	irregular past tenses (e.g., think 7 thought), but argue that regular
	past tenses (e.g., walk --> walked) are generated via a +ed rule
	and that a principled account of regular inflection can only be given
	by recourse to explicit rules. This debate has become a crucial battleground
	for arguments concerning the necessity and importance of abstract
	mental rules, embracing not only language processing, but also the
	of nature cognition itself. However, in centering on the roles of
	phonological similarity and rules, the past tense debate has largely
	ignored the possible role of semantics in determining inflection.
	This paper presents five studies that demonstrate a striking and
	decisive role of semantic similarity in inflection. In fact, semantic
	factors appear to be more important in inflection than the grammatical
	considerations put forward by the dual-route account. Further, these
	new findings provide a new way of discriminating between the claims
	of single-route (similarity-based) and dual-route (rule-based) approaches.
	It appears that inflection is carried out through analogical reminding
	based on semantic and phonological similarity and that a rule-based
	route is not necessary to account for past tense inflection.},

  abstract = {It has been shown that the processing of irregular past-tense forms
	is affected by phonological factors that are inherent in the relationship
	of the past-tense forms to other words in the lexicon (rhyming families
	of irregulars) or to their base forms (vowel dominance effects).
	This paper addresses more ephemeral phonological effects. In a sentence-production
	task, the vowel of the base form or past-tense form of an irregular
	verb (e.g., /i/ of freeze or /oupsilon/ of froze) is primed by an
	identical vowel in the subject noun (e.g., base vowel cream, past-tense
	vowel chrome, unrelated vowel slot). For verbs with different vowels
	in the base form and past-tense form, phonological priming of the
	base vowel or of the past-tense vowel increases the rate of overregularization
	errors such as *freezed as compared to an unrelated vowel prime.
	For verbs with the same vowel in the base and past-tense forms (e.g.,
	hit/hit), phonological printing has no effect on the rate of overregularization
	errors. It is argued that irregular forms are not produced in a specialized
	subnetwork for (irregular) past-tense forms, but are produced in
	the general lexical system simultaneous with general phonological
	processing. Implications for theories of inflectional morphology
