For example, expression $3\times 4 = 12$ should be set this way, \texttt{\$3$\backslash$times 4=12\$}, not this way, \texttt{3 \$$\backslash$times\$4=12}.\item[(b) Markup:] Keep markup as simple as possible. Special spacing commands such as \texttt{$\backslash$,} and \texttt{$\sim$} should not be used, since they may complicate whitespace handling in the XML file.\item[(c) Reference callouts:] Set reference callouts with standard \verb+\cite{}+ command or set manually inside square brackets (JON no longer uses superscript reference callouts \cite{IEEE98,Zhao02} or the \texttt{overcite} package). For more on references, see note \cite{refs} below.\item[(d) Style:] Review and adhere to guidelines given in the \mbox{\href{http://www.osa-jon.org/submission}{JON style manual}}.\end{description}\section{Figures, Tables, and Multimedia}JON encourages authors to submit color and multimedia figures with their manuscripts. Guidelines on multimedia submissions can be found at \mbox{\url{http://www.osa-jon.org/submission}}. Figures and tables may be placed in the body of the manuscript. To include multimedia, set a static image (e.g., frame from a video) in the manuscript as a figure, and upload multimedia files separately. \begin{table}[htb] \centering \textbf{\caption{Sample Table}}\begin{tabular}{ccc}    \hline    One & Two & Three \\    \hline    Eins & Zwei & Drei \\    Un & Deux & Trois \\    Jeden & Dv\v{e} & T\v{r}i \\    \hline   \end{tabular}    \end{table}\begin{figure}[htb]\centerline{\scalebox{.92}{\includegraphics{JONF1.eps}}}\caption{Sample caption (Ref. \cite{Sahin02}, Fig. 1).}\end{figure}\section{Conclusion}After proofreading the manuscript, tar and gzip the \texttt{.tex} file andfigures; then enter the requested information into the JONonline submission system at \\\url{http://www.osa-jon.org} and upload the tarred and gzippedarchive. If there is video or other multimedia, the associatedfiles should be uploaded separately.All papers are accepted subject to editing to ensure readabilityand conformity to journal style. Authors will receive page proofsof their papers. Corrected proofs should be returned within 48hours of receipt to avoid publication delays. For furtherinstructions, please see the JON web pages.%\appendix%\section*{Appendix A:  \LaTeX{} Code for Appendices}%\setcounter{equation}{0}%\renewcommand{\theequation}{A{\arabic{equation}}}%acknowledgments%\section*{Acknowledgments}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% References %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{thebibliography}{99}\bibitem{IEEE98} IEEE Standard 802.1Q-1998, ``IEEE standards for local and metropolitan area networks: virtual bridged local area networks'' (Institute ofElectrical and Electronics Engineers, New York, 1999), \url{http://www.ieee.org}.\bibitem{Zhao02}  M.
