                    PACKAGES KOI8 AND RAWPRINT

                        September 24, 1996

These packages are intended for typesetting Russian texts. 

1. Package koi8 (written by Uri Blumenthal <uri@watson.ibm.com> with
minor modifications by Boris Veytsman <boris@plmsc.psu.edu>).

It performs internal translation from the KOI-8 encoding (de-facto
standard of the UNIX world) to the so called ``alternative encoding''
used by most Cyrillic packages. You still need one of these packages
for the acual Russian typesetting. The style works with all major
Cyrillic packages: cmcyr, cmcyralt, LH. The usage is very simple:

In LaTeX2e
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lh,koi8}
\begin{document}
  SOME TEXT IN KOI-8
\end{document}

In LaTeX2.09
\documentstyle{lh,koi8,article}
\begin{document}
  SOME TEXT IN KOI-8
\end{document}


Substitute cmcyr or cmcyralt for lh if you use these packages.


2. Package rawprint 

This package is intended for ``quick and dirty'' printing of raw
(i.e. non-TeX) Russian texts by persons who (like me) do not have
Russian printer fonts (but have Cyrillic TeX). It makes #, $, % and &
``normal'' letters and converts the ``unisex'' quote character " into
Russian-style << and >> quotes. The usage (in LaTeX2e) is:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lh,rawprint}
\begin{document}
\input{document_in_alt_encoding.txt}
\end{document}

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lh,koi8,rawprint}
\begin{document}
\input{document_in_koi8_encoding.txt}
\end{document}

and the LaTeX2.09 usage should be quite obvious.

Please note that making % a letter is a rather drastic solution. Since
most LaTeX style files have some comments delimited by the percent
signs, the package rawprint must be invoked as the LAST one. The line
\usepackage{rawprint,lh} will cause you lots of grief.

Happy LaTeXing in Russian!
