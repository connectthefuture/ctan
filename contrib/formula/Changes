formula 0.2:
April 28, 1998
 - The names of formula commands were build in formula 0.1 after the
   scheme  <my_inital_letters><what_to_do>  for instance
                          <at><mathdef>
   This was done to avoid redefining any other definitions.
   Because my inital letters (at) didn't make any sense, I renamed
   such definitions to
                    <formula><what_to_do>
 - The files newformula (UNIX) and newform.bat (DOS) will help you
   converting your definitions to the new names (and will tell you
   the changes)
 - Bug in \eorg when no German hyphenation patterns are loaded corrected
 - Formula logo
 - (small) part of documentation translated into English
