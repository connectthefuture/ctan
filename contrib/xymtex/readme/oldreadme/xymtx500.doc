`XyMTeX' is a macro package for drawing chemical structural formulas. 

(1) Setting up 

    The XyMTeX system has been frozen with ZIP.  Set up according to the software 
    situation of your computer. 

    The following is only one example. Let the frozen package 
  (xymtx500.zip) be placed in the c:\temp directory, 
  where the package is melt with an appropriate software for melting. 
  Thereby, the directory <\xymtex> is automatically created as the 
  subdirectory of the c:\temp directory. And the following hierarchy of 
  directories and files is generated. 
  
  (For full document directories, visit the original deposit of the latest version at 
   http://xymtex.com/ (Shonan Institute of Chemoinformatics and Mathematical 
   Chemistry)).

   Each of the package (sty) files in the \xymtex directory contains the macro 
  codes of XymTeX commands. The specification of XyMTeX commands can be printed out 
  after making a driving file. For the chemstr package as an example, commands 
  to be typed in a prompt line are as follows: 
  
  c:\temp> latex chemstr.ins
  c:\temp> latex chemstr.drv
  
  Thereby, you will obtain chemstr.dvi, which is a document of the chemstr package. 

  The on-line manuals of the old versions (pdf files) stored in respective directories 
  are effective even to the present version 5.00. The directory \doc500 contains 
  two on-line documents, xymtx500.pdf and xymtx500PS.pdf, which have the same contents 
  but are differently processed: 
  
     xymtx500.pdf  ---- processed by elatex and converted into PDF by dvipdfmx
     xymtx500PS.pdf ---- processed by elatex and converted into PS by dvips, then 
                         further converted into PDF by Adobe Distiller.  
 
 They can be browsed with Adobe Reader.  
  

(2) Designating a serach path 

  Do this task according to the situtation of your computer.
  
  The path searching tool (kpathsea) supported by usual TeX distributions has already decided 
  several input directories (named ``tex'' or others). Hence, you should only place the resulting 
  ``xymtex'' directry generated from xymtx500.zip in such an appropriate directory named  
  ``tex'' or others (e.g., c:\usr\local\share\texmf\tex\latex).  

(3) Writing your manuscript 

   According to remarkable expansion of computer capacities, all of the package files of 
   the XyMTeX system can be loaded simultaneously in a tex file. You can adopt one of 
   the three modes of the XyMTeX system. 
   
   -1) For using  the LaTeX picture environment and epic (TeX/LaTeX mode): 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{xymtex}
    \usepackage{chemist}

  -2) For using under PostScript-compatible mode due to PSTricks techniques: 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{xymtxps}
    \usepackage{chmst-ps}

  -3) For using under PDF-compatible mode due to pgf techniques: 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{xymtxpdf}
    \usepackage{chmst-pdf}
 
 
  The include packages (chemist.sty, chmst-ps.sty, chemtimes.sty, chmst-pdf) should be 
  loaded separately after xymtex.sty, xymtexps.sty, or xymtexpdf.sty is loaded. 

(4) Running LaTeX2e (or pLaTeX2e in Japanese)

   You should use XyMTeX commands within LaTeX to creat a dvi file. Note that, 
   as for the PDF-compatible mode, you should use elatex (or eplatex in Japanese) 
   during LaTeX processing. 

(5) PDF-compatible mode: Conversion of the dvi file into a PDF file (by e.g., dvipdfmx)

(5') PostScript-compatible mode:  
      --a) Conversion of the dvi file into a PostScript file (by e.g., dvips)
      --b) Conversion of the PostScript file into a PDF file (by e.g., Adobe Distiller)
