File manifest.txt for package curve2e
        [2015/07/11 v.1.60 Extension package for pict2e]


The package bundle curve2e is composed of the following files

curve2e.dtx
curve2e.pdf
mainfest.txt
README.txt

Manifest.txt is this file.

curve2e.dtx is the documented TeX source file of file curve2e.sty; you get
both curve2e.sty and curve2e.pdf by running pdflatex on curve2e.dtx.

README.txt contains general information.

The package has the LPPL status of author maintained.

According to the LPPL licence, you are entitled to modify this package,
as long as you fulfil the few conditions set forth by the Licence.

Nevertheless this package is an extension to the standard LaTeX package pict2e
(2014). Therefore  any change must be controlled  against the parent package
pict2e so as to avoid redefining what has already been incorporated in the
official package.

If you prefer sending me your modifications, as long as I will maintain this
package, I will possibly include every (documented) suggestion or modification
into this package.
