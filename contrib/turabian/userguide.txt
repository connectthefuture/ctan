[2] About this Class
--------------------
Turabian LaTeX Class is a LaTeX class written and maintained by Wesley Surber of
Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary.  The Turabian class and template are not endorsed or supported by the University or the Seminary.  Students should always consult with their professor prior to using the package to ensure that the course will allow projects submitted in PDF format.

TeX and LaTeX have long been embraced by the scientific and professional
publishing communities.  However, little is known of the capabilities for
application of LaTeX authoring and publishing in theology and its related
disciplines.  Many templates exist to assist students and researchers designing
complex projects using Chicago, MLA, APA, APJ, and a multitude of obscure and
school-specific formats using TeX, LaTeX, or one of its derivatives.  Until now,
no suitable document class exists to fulfill the needs of seminary students 
working in the fields of theology, apologetics, or related disciplines.  The
allure of LaTeX is the ability to design internal commands and macros that allow
an author to accomplish complex tasks with ease.

The increasing utility of hand held devices such as Apple's iPad and laptops
running flavors of GNU/Linux that are incapable of providing reliable, native
access to Microsoft Office is increasingly driving technical writers into the
arms of open source, platform independent software like LaTeX.  It was this
platform independence and need for strict formatting control that initially
attracted me to the LaTeX platform and inspired me to begin using it for all of
my seminary research projects.  However, an efficient method for typesetting
projects in Turabian format was nowhere to be found, so I decided to build one.

In a nutshell, Turabian LaTeX Class is my attempt to open the door for the world
of theological and religious research to embrace the world of TeX and LaTeX.
This package is modeled using the most current Turabian style guide, A Manual for
Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations: 8th Edition, by Kate L.
Turabian.  The purpose of Turabian LaTeX Class is to allow seminary students to
focus entirely on their research without having to devote inordinate amounts of
time to validating the style and format of their research papers.


[3] The Class
-------------
Turabian LaTeX Class is implemented using a combination of two files:
turabian.cls and turabian.tex.  The Turabian class file (cls) contains the core
formatting commands necessary to apply Turabian typesetting style to the
TeXfile (tex).  Custom tex files can be generated and used with the Turabian
class, but using the included Liberty University Turabian format template as a
starting point is recommended for best results.

	DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
		|
		|---- TURABIAN.CLS - Class file.
		|---- TURABIAN.TEX - Sample template based on Liberty University guidelines.
		|---- README.TXT - CTAN.org README file.
		|---- USERGUIDE.TXT - This user guide.


[4] Basic Commands
------------------
This package is designed to reduce the amount of time that a student or other
writers spend on formatting their Turabian papers.  To facilitate this goal, a
series of proprietary commands have been developed within the class file itself.
This is an exhaustive list of the basic commands in the Turabian package.

	\papercontents (formerly \contentstable)
	This command realigns the default LaTeX table of contents macro and produces
	a standard Turabian table of contents.  The old Turabian LaTeX Class 
    \contentstable command is depreciated as of version 0.1.0.
    
    \contents
	Begins the paper's main content, formats text for double-spacing.
    
	\bibliography
	Inserts a new page header and begins the paper's Bibliography.
	
	\bibline{}
	Produces a standard Turabian formatted Bibliography entry.
	NOTE: BibTeX support will be coming in a future release.  
    
    
The following commands have been eliminated from this release.  For specific formatting requirements such as paragraph indents for the table of contents or figure lists, consult standard LaTeX formatting options such as \parindent.

	\headpage
	This command produces a standard Turabian title page.
	
		\tocone{}
		A table of contents item, flush with the left margin with BOLD text.
		
		\toctwo{}
		A table of contents item, indented 4 spaces (TAB) from the left margin.
		
		\tocthree{}
		A table of contents item, indented 8 spaces (2x TAB) from the left margin.
		
		\tocfour{}
		A table of contents item, indented 12 spaces (3x TAB) from the left.  The 
        8th edition of the Turabian guide does not recommend having more than 
        three to four levels of headings on any single project.
			
	\header{}
	Produces a Turabian-formatted header with BOLD text.
	
	\subheader{}
	Produces a Turabian-formatted sub header with EMPHASIZED text.
	



[5] Advanced Formatting Options
-------------------------------
While most of the basic formatting options for Turabian-formatted projects are
available within the Turabian class file, there are some formatting 
requirements that are not included in the class file for various reasons.  This
section of the user guide will provide you with guidelines for making advanced
formatting choices and fixing some common problems with creating a Turabian
document in LaTeX.

	\vspace{5mm}
	5mm has been determined as the best substitute for a double-spaced carriage
	return in the theology package.  This works well for properly formatting the
	Bibliography page.

	
[6] Hebrew and Greek Text Support
---------------------------------
The ability to properly render Hebrew and Greek characters is critical for anyone
working on theology projects.  These two biblical root languages are necessary
for any serious exegetical process and are now fully supported in Turabian for
LaTeX.  

	\textgreek{YOUR GREEK HERE}
    Place any Greek text inside the brackets to print Greek words.
    
    \cjRL{HEBREW CODE HERE}
    Places Hebrew text into the LaTeX document using character codes.  Refer to the cjRL Hebrew documentation for specific character requirements.
