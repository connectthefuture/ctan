This work consists of the files listed in manifest.txt

This work consists of the following files:

    manifest.txt
    toptesi.dtx
    toptesi-example.tex
    toptesi-example-luatex.tex
    toptesi-example-con-frontespizio.tex
    topfront-example
    README
    toptesi-it-pdftex.tex
    
The files derived from the work are the following:

    toptesi.cls
    toptesi.sty
    topcoman.sty
    topfront.sty
    toptesi.cfg
    toptesi.pdf
    toptesi-example.pdf
    toptesi-example-xetex.pdf
    toptesi-example-con-frontespizio.pdf
    topfront-example.pdf
    toptesi-it-pdftex.pdf

The toptesi.dtx file is self extracting and self documenting; if you run
pdflatex on it you get at the same time the class, the style files besides 
the toptesi configuration file, together with the English documented file.

The Italian documentation is obtained by running pdfLaTeX or LuaLaTeX on
toptesi-it.tex; this documentation has been completely redone compared
to previous versions. With both compilers the result should be PDF/A-1b
 compliant

The two documentations pdf files, toptesi.pdf and toptesi-it.pdf,
are complementary to one another.
 
The four files

toptesi-example.tex 
toptesi-example-luatex.tex  
topfront-example.tex
toptesi-example-con-frontespizio.tex

are examples of the usage of this work, the first, third and fourth to be 
run with pdfLaTeX, the second with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX; they may be used 
as templates, but in themselves, although part of this Work, they may be 
used by the end user the way s/he likes best, in order to use them as 
templates, but the files should not be modified unless their names are 
changed.

Warning: The PDF examples attached to this bundle contain some fake university 
logos; the real logos are not distributed with this bundle since they are a 
property of the specific universities. You can download them directly from 
the university sites, or you may change the logo file names with those of 
other institutions, in particular that of your own university; or you may 
substitute them with picture file names of your choice, since they are just 
examples of usage and they have no particular meaning in the sample files.
Remember: you can edit the sample/template files the way you want, provided 
you change their names.
