used in the LaTeX Project Public License, are to be interpreted
in the case of this work.

April 1, 2015 (vers. 0.36)



MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the C.D.P. Bundle, the "Work" is the collection of the 
following 4 files:

00readme.txt    --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt    --  the file you are reading now
cdpbundl.dtx    --  main source file
cdpbundl.ins    --  installation script

If you have received the 4 files listed above, you possess an integral copy 
of the C.D.P. Bundle.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the C.D.P. Bundle, a "Compiled Work" is the collection of:

a) the following 2 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

00readme.txt
manifest.txt

AND
b) the following 11 files:

letteracdp.cls          --  the letteracdp LaTeX document class
articoletteracdp.cls    --  the articoletteracdp LaTeX document class
cdpaddon.sty            --  the cdpaddon LaTeX package
cdpbabel.sty            --  the cdpbabel LaTeX package
cdpnamesenglish.ldf     --  language-dependent definitions of the captions
cdpnamesitalian.ldf     /
cdpshues-example.def    --  prototype color definition file
epson-stylus-740.def    --  other example color definition files
hp-laserjet-4500.def    /
cdpshues.cfg            --  configuration file for the cdpaddon package
cdpbundl.dvi            --  full documentation in DVI format

You may, at your option, substitute the file `cdpbundl.dvi' with either 
one (or both) of the following two files:

cdpbundl.pdf            --  full documentation in PDF
cdpbundl-doc.pdf        --  overview of the C.D.P. Bundle (PDF)

but at least one among the files `cdpbundl.dvi', `cdpbundl.pdf', and 
`cdpbundl-doc.pdf' must be included in a "Compiled Work" that you intend 
to distribute.  The file `cdpbundl.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the 
program pdflatex the file `cdpbundl.dtx', following the same steps as 
those explained in `00readme.txt' under the title "How to generate the 
documentation".



ANCILLARY FILES
===============

The package of files distributed through the Comprehensive TeX Archive 
Network (CTAN) includes also the following five files:

README              --  guide to directory contents
cdpbundl-doc.pdf    --  overview of the C.D.P. Bundle (PDF)
cdp-ver-0-36.pdf    --  instructions specific to version 0.36 (PDF)
cdp-ver-0-36.tex    --  LaTeX source of the preceding item
Makefile            --  Makefile to generate code and/or documentation

These five files are included only for convenience's sake and are _not_ a 
required part of the C.D.P. Bundle (of course you may, if you wish, include 
them in your distribution too).



COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of the 
C.D.P. Bundle, it suffices to distribute only the 4 files that constitute 
the "Work".
