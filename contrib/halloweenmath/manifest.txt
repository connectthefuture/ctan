used in the LaTeX Project Public License, are to be interpreted in the
case of this work.

MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the halloweenmath package, the "Work" is the collection
of the following 4 files:

00readme.txt        --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt        --  the file you are reading now
halloweenmath.dtx   --  main source file
halloweenmath.ins   --  installation script

If you have received the 4 files listed above, you possess an integral
copy of the halloweenmath package.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the halloweenmath package, a "Compiled Work" is the
collection of:

a) the following 2 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

00readme.txt
manifest.txt

AND
b) the following 2 files:

halloweenmath.sty   --  the halloweenmath LaTeX package
halloweenmath.dvi   --  full documentation in DVI format

You may, at your option, substitute the file `halloweenmath.dvi' with
either one (or both) of the following two files:

halloweenmath.pdf       --  full documentation in PDF
halloweenmath-doc.pdf   --  overview of the halloweenmath package (PDF)

but at least one among the files `halloweenmath.dvi',
`halloweenmath.pdf', and `halloweenmath-doc.pdf' must be included in a
"Compiled Work" that you intend to distribute.  The file
`halloweenmath.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the program pdflatex
the file `halloweenmath.dtx', following the same steps as those
explained in `00readme.txt' under the title "How to generate the
documentation".



ANCILLARY FILES
===============

The package of files distributed through the Comprehensive TeX Archive 
Network (CTAN) includes also the following five files:

README                  --  guide to directory contents
halloweenmath-doc.pdf   --  overview of the halloweenmath package (PDF)
halloweenmath-man.pdf   --  user's manual for this same package (PDF)
halloweenmath-man.tex   --  LaTeX source of the preceding item
Makefile                --  Makefile to generate code or documentation

These five files are included only for convenience's sake and are _not_
a required part of the halloweenmath package (of course you may, if you
wish, include them in your distribution too).



COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of
the halloweenmath package, it suffices to distribute only the 4 files
that constitute the "Work".
