In this  document the following terms are used:

    The files TEXNIKA.dtx, poetry.dtx, drama.dtx, technica.ins and
    the derived files TEXNIKA.sty, poetry.sty, drama.sty

   `Derived Work'
    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

   `Modification' 
    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language.

   `Modify'
    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
    applicable law.
    
   `Distribution'
    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).


CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================

1.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.

2. The Copyright Holder may, without restriction, modify the Work,
thus creating a Derived Work. The Copyright Holder may also distribute
the Derived Work without restriction. Derived Works distributed in
this manner by the Copyright Holder are considered to be updated
versions of the Work.

3.  If you are not the Copyright Holder, you are not allowed
to modify the Work.

4.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do
not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
becomes identical to an  updated version of that component of the Work as
it is distributed by the Copyright Holder under Clause 2, above.

5. Distribution of the Work in an alternative format, where the Work
is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not
relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the
results of applying that process.

6. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
such works with the Work by any means.

7.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.


CONDITIONS ON USE
=================

The Work may be used without charge for non-commercial private
or academic purposes. Use of the Work for commercial purposes is
prohibited. To use the Work for commercial purposes you must obtain a
license for commercial use from the Copyright Holder.


NO WARRANTY
===========

There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless agreed to in writing will the Copyright Holder or
any other party who may distribute the Work as permitted above, be
liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental
or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out
of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of
data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone
as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said other party has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.
