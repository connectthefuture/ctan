`XyMTeX' is a macro package for drawing chemical structural formulas. 

(1) Setting up 

    This package has been frozen with ZIP.  Set up according to the software 
    situation of your computer. 

    The following is only one example. Let the frozen package 
  (xymtx405.zip) be placed in the c:\temp directory, where the package 
  is melt with an appropriate software for melting. Thereby, 
  the directory <\xymtex> is automatically created as the 
  subdirectory of the c:\temp directory; and the following hierarchy of 
  directories and files is generated. 

  c---\temp---\xymtex --- xymtex.sty, xymtexps.sty 
    |      |          |   hetaromh.sty, hetarom.sty, ccycle.sty, 
                      |   chemstr.sty, carom.sty, lowcycl.sty, aliphat.sty,

   Each of the package (sty) files in the \xymtex directory contains the macro 
  codes of XymTeX commands. The specification of XyMTeX commands and 
  examples of using these commands are included in the xymtex.dvi file of 
  the \doc... directory. 

   The three tex files, xymtx405A.tex, xymtx405A.tex, and xymtx405A.tex 
  in the \doc405\jobdoc405 directory is the main files of the manuscript 
  for creating the corresponding xymtx405A.dvi, xymtx405B.dvi, and xymtx405C.dvi. 
  Thise dvi files (not included) have been further converted into 
  the corresponding PostScript files (xymtx405A.ps etc.), which should be browsed by 
  using an appropriate PostScript view. This Postscript files have been further 
  converted into PDF files (named xymtx405A.pdf etc.), which can be browsed 
  with Adobe Acrobat.  

========================for old documentations==================================
   The xymtx200.dvi file is a dvi file that is a manual for utilizing 
  XyMTeX (about 100 pages). The processed dvi file can be obtained in the same 
  directory of this distribution.  It can be printed with an appropriate 
  printer driver (dviout, or others) and can be displayed with an 
  appropriate previewer (dviout, etc.).  The corresponding PDF file (xymtx200.pdf)
  is also available. 

   The xymtx300.tex is the main file of the manuscript for creating the 
  xymtx300.dvi. The other tex files in the \doc300 directory are input files 
  which are read by the main file. The corresponding PDF file (xymtx300.pdf)
  is also available.

   The xymtx401.tex in the \doc401\jobdoc401 directory is the main file of the manuscript 
  for creating the xymtx401.dvi. This dvi file has bee furthern converted into 
  the corresponding PostScript file (xymtx401.ps), which should be browsed by 
  using an appropriate PostScript view. This Postscript file has been further 
  converted into a PDF file (named xymtx401.pdf), which can be browsed 
  with Adobe Acrobat.  

  Caution: Don't browse xymtx401.dvi by a dvi-ware such as dviout! 

   The other tex files in the \doc401\jobdoc401 directory are input files 
  which are read by the main file. 

   The xymtx402403.tex in the \doc402403\jobdoc402 directory is the main file of the manuscript 
  for creating the xymtx402403.dvi. This dvi file has bee furthern converted into 
  the corresponding PostScript file (xymtx402403.ps), which should be browsed by 
  using an appropriate PostScript view. This Postscript file has been further 
  converted into a PDF file (named xymtx402403.pdf), which can be browsed 
  with Adobe Acrobat.  

  Caution: Don't browse xymtx402403.dvi by a dvi-ware such as dviout! 

   The other tex files in the \doc402403\jobdoc402 directory are input files 
  which are read by the main file. 

   The xymtx404.tex in the \doc404\jobdoc directory is the main file of the manuscript 
  for creating the xymtx404.dvi. This dvi file has been further converted into 
  the corresponding PostScript file (xymtx404.ps), which should be browsed by 
  using an appropriate PostScript view. This Postscript file has been further 
  converted into a PDF file (named xymtx404.pdf), which can be browsed 
  with Adobe Acrobat.  

  Caution: Don't browse xymtx404.dvi by a dvi-ware such as dviout! 

   The other tex files in the \doc404\jobdoc directory are input files 
  which are read by the main file. 
====================================================================  


(2) Designating a serach path 

  Do this task according to the situtation of your computer.
  
  The path searching tool (kpathsea) supported by usual TeX distributions has already decided 
  several input directories (named ``tex'' or others). Hence, you should only place the resulting 
  ``xymtex'' directry generated from xymtx405.zip in such an appropriate directory named  
  ``tex'' or others (e.g., c:\usr\local\share\texmf\tex\latex).  

(3) Writing your manuscript 

   Each command of XyMTeX can be used if you add the name of the 
   corresponding style file to the option list at the top of your 
   manuscript file, e.g. 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{epic,hetarom,hetaromh,xymtx-ps}
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  where the underlined names are XyMTeX package files containing your 
  requisite commands. If all of the XyMTeX commands are required, 
  the short-cut declaration (recommended because of advanced capacities of 
  personal computers):
   
    For using the LaTeX picture environment and epic: 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{xymtex}

    For using under Postscript mode due to PSTricks techiques: 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{xymtxps}
 
  can be used for simplicity. The include packages (chemist.sty, chmst-ps.sty, 
  chemtimes.sty) should be loaded separately after xymtex.sty or xymtexps.sty 
  is loaded. 

(4) Running LaTeX2e or pLaTeX2e

   You should use XyMTeX commands within LaTeX to creat a dvi file. 
   
(5) Conversion of the dvi file into a PostScript file (by e.g., dvipsk)
(6) Conversion of the PostScript file into a PDF file (by e.g., Adobe Distiller)
