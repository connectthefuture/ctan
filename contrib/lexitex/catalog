Description: LexiBib is a *.bst file for use with BibTeX,
             which creates a *.bbl file containing citations
             embedded in a `lexilist' environment, suitable
             for digestion by LexiTeX.  The style is still
             under construction, but getting more useful as
             the support for BibTeX entry types grows.
             This is the only BibTeX style package that
             supports citations to law cases and statutes.
