\chapter{My first experiment}
\label{ch:firstExp}

This is my first experiment. I will try to prove the following things:
(Note that lists are single spaced, as Rackham wants, and that lists should
start a new paragraph, otherwise the single spacing will also apply to the
preceding paragraph).

\begin{itemize}
  \item lists are easy to use
  \item \LaTeX\ rocks
\end{itemize}

The following figure was drawn using the excellent pgf/tikz graphics package.
If you do not have this package, you should comment it out.

The rest of this chapter proceeds as follows. Section \ref{sec:design}
describes the experiment design, while section~\ref{subsec:req} details the
requirements and section~\ref{subsubsec:setup} describes the experiment setup.
Section ~\ref{sec:method} describes my methods, while
section~\ref{subsec:procedures} gives details of the procedures and
section~\ref{subsubsec:firstSteps} goes over the first steps.

The sound lab is needed.
\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
I describe my methods in this section
\subsection{Procedures}
\label{subsec:procedures}
The following procedures were followed.
\subsubsection{First steps}
\label{subsubsec:firstSteps}
We carried out the experiment with the undergrads.
