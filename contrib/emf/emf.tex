\section{Introduktion}
\label{sec:introduktion}

This package provides \LaTeX\ support for the symbol for the EMF
($\emf$) in electric circuits and electrodynamics. It provides support
for multiple symbols but does not provide any fonts. The fonts
themselves must be aquired otherwise. However the fonts are part of a
normal \TeX Live installation.

\section{Usage}
\label{sec:usage}

\subsection{Loading the package}
\label{sec:loading-package}
\begin{lstlisting}
\usepackage{emf}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Options}
\label{sec:options}
\begin{description}
\item[scale=$\langle num\rangle$] Set a scale factor for the font. As
  this package as much as possible relies on existing font support the
  `scale' option only applies to some of the fonts. Some of the fonts
  are scaled as default. Thus the `scale' option changes this as the
  scale factors are not multiplied.

\item[boondox] Use the calligraphical E from the STIX fonts: $\emf$.
  This is the default of the package. It is possible to scale this
  symbol. The default scale is 1.1.

\item[calligra] Use the calligraphical E from the Calligra font:
  $\emfcalligra$. It is possible to scale this
  symbol. The default scale is 1.07.

\item[chorus] Use the calligraphical E from the \TeX\ Gyre Chorus
  font (Chancery): $\emfchorus$. It is
  possible to scale this symbol. The default scale is 1.22.

\item[cmr] Use the calligraphical E from Computer Modern: $\mathcal{E}$.

\item[fourier] Use the calligraphical E from the fourier fonts
  (Utopia like): $\emffourier$.

\item[frcursive] Use the E from the French Cursive font: $\emffrcursive$.

\item[miama] Use the E from the Miama Nueva font: $\emfmiama$. It is
  possible to scale this symbol. The default scale is 0.85.

\item[rsfs] Use the E from \textsl{Ralph Smiths Formal Script:} $\emfrsfs$.

\item[cal] Use the default calligraphical E of the document. In this
  document from Computer Modern: $\mathcal{E}$. This option depends on
  the math fonts loaded by the user.

\item[u0] Use the notation $U_0$ as a symbol for EMF.

\item[U0] The same as otion `u0'.

\item[text=$\langle \mathit{text}\rangle$] Use $\mathit{text}$ as
  symbol. The default is $\mathit{EMF}$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Command}
\label{sec:command}

To access the selected symbol just type \lstinline|\emf| in your
document. \lstinline|\emf| only applies to math mode.
