18 December 1200 (20 December 2016):  Ellipses were able to
start lines, which shouldn't happen; fixed that.  Added
command \xelipend, which eliminates closing spaces for the
situation in which the ellipsis is immediately followed by
punctuation.  Version 1.2.

12 November 1200 (14 November 2016):  Fixed a bug in how
\xelip behaved at the beginning of an environment.
Specifically, it was set before paragraph mode began.  A
zero-space \hskip puts TeX in paragraph mode now, so \xelip
is placed properly.  Version 1.1.

10 October 11EE (12 October 2015):  Initial release.
