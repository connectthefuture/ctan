Description: Camel is a style package for LaTeX2e that lays the
   foundation for greatly improved handling of bibliographic
   material.  It is the only fully supported bibliography package to
   offer support for legal citation styles, and the only system
   within reach of handling other styles that require 'ibid.' and
   the like.  A programmer's library for BibTeX that includes
   functions supporting streamlined entry of citation details
   and dates is contained in the package.  Treat this as ALPHA
   software, but alpha software with a future.
Keywords: law, legal, lawyer, bibliography, BibTeX,
