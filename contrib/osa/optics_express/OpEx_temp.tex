\begin{abstract}
A simple template with some examples is provided for preparing \textit{Optics Express} manuscripts in \LaTeX. For complete instructions, see \texttt{OpEx\_style.tex}. Note that the style file \texttt{opex3.sty} replaces \texttt{opex2.sty}. Additional information on style and submissions is available at \mbox{\url{http://www.opticsexpress.org/submission}}.

\section{Introduction}

Standard \LaTeX{} or AMS\TeX{} environments should be used to place tables, figures, and math. Examples are given below.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
%\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{opexfig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Ref. \cite{Oron03}, Fig. 2).}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{2m}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \frac{1}{2} M{\Omega}^2
     (x^2 + y^2) + \omega (x p_y - y p_x).
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, tar and gzip the \texttt{.tex} file and
figures; then enter the requested information into the \textit{Optics Express}
online submission system at \url{http://www.opticsexpress.org} and upload the tarred and gzipped archive. If there is video or other multimedia, the associated
files should be uploaded separately.
